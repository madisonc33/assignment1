    <p>I really enjoy programming and a, looking forward to learning a stricter language and developing my programming skills further through IS 413. I've learned a little of Java through my tutoring job, so I recognized some of the formatting, but would love to better understand it. I also am excited to get more practice with the back-end to have a better understanding of that side of development. I hope that even though I run on MAC, that I can still follow everything smoothly and receive guidance if anything is different.</p>
